Bank Term Deposit Subscription Marketing Analysis
Aim of the Project:
The aim of the project is to monitor perfomance
of a Banks Term Deposit Marketing Campaign. The
campaign is to sign-up banks existing customers
for long deposit products offered by the bank.
Project Overview:
1) Using data from campaign metrics and consumer
demographics, the dashboards will show subscriber
statistics.
2) The conclusions drawn from the dashboard
cannot be used to make campaign decisions at a
high level, but rather to postulate for further
investigation.
